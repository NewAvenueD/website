title: About New Avenue
---
We’re a group of committed dental professionals who believe taking care of your teeth should be easy. After hearing for years from patients how difficult it can be to fit appointments into their busy schedules we thought there has to be a better way.

>What if we brought dental care to the patients? What if we used technology to take the friction out of the appointment process? What if patients have just been making excuses all along?

So we built a high-tech, full-service dental office on wheels to take to busy patients at their workplace. New Avenue Dentistry was born of a belief that dentistry could be done differently and we’re passionate about making healthy teeth more attainable for working patients. We would love to work with you to brighten smiles around your workplace.

###About On-site Dentistry
On-site dentistry is not a new idea, but it is having it’s day in the era of the smartphone. Respected and innovative organizations from Google and Dropbox to ConocoPhillips and NASA have recognized the value of providing this benefit to their employees. On-site dentistry benefits employers and employees because it decreases dental and medical expenditures, increases productivity by cutting down on the time it takes to see a dentist, and leads to a happier, healthier workforce. All of these benefits are at no additional cost or administrative burden to the employer.
