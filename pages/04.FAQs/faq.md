  1:
    q: What is 'mobile dentistry?'
    a: Dental care in a mobile dental office offers the same level of care you can receive in a traditional office, but fits better with your or your employees’ schedule. Mobile dentistry has been around for decades, and has been used to treat employees at their work since the late 1990's. The concept is simple: instead of making the patient come to us, we come to you.
  2:
    q: Why use mobile dentistry?
    a: Going to the dentist can be hard. By the time you factor in travel and the waiting room, the average appointment time in a major city is 3-4 hours, causing many people to have to take a half day from work just to get a check-up. We’re making dental visits easier by bringing the dentist to employees at their workplace. This saves employees time, and increases workplace productivity. It's a zero cost additional employee benefit that can save the employee and employer time and money.

  3:
    q: How does it work?
    a: We work with Human Resources teams and building/facility managers to schedule times to be on-site and available for appointments. Patients choose the times that work best for them, get reminders leading up to their appointment and notifications when we’re ready to see them. We provide top quality care with none of the time, travel or hassle of going to see a traditional dentist.
  4:
    q: Is this just for check-ups and cleanings?
    a: Inside our state of the art mobile facility, we have everything necessary to provide the same level of dental care you would find at a traditional office. Using the latest technology, we provide a full range of dental treatment including: preventive care, cleanings, digital X-rays, whitening, cosmetic procedures, Invisalign, and surgical treatment.

  5:
    q: How do you handle emergencies?
    a: Just like a normal office, our mobile practice provides emergency care during normal business hours. If we are not on-site at your facility or nearby in the event of a dental emergency, we have arrangements with local dentists to provide follow-up care.
